#Pong in about 50 lines (not including spaces and notes)

Coded using LÃ–VE framework, https://love2d.org/
Adding path, https://love2d.org/wiki/PATH you will probably need to add this or it will error
pong.lua and main.lua in same folder
To execute, navigate to directory and type 'love .' in terminal
You can move paddles using 'w' and 'down arrow'

#Confirguration
To change ball speed in line 4 change vx = 150, vy = -50, to make it faster making it vx = 200, vy = -100 for example.
To change paddle speed change lines 29, 32, 35 and 38. Change the number in each line to the same value.
To change size you obviously change 'size = 10' to a higher value.
The code itself can use improvement but I just wanted a code with little lines.
The actual game is not very immersive but it works.
